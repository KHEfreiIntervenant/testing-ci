// Import commands.js using ES2015 syntax:
import './commands'

// Alternatively you can use CommonJS syntax:
// require('./commands')

// This is a support file that runs before each test file.
// You can put global configurations and custom commands here.

// Cypress comes with a lot of default functionality that can be extended.
// This file provides a place to put global configuration and behavior
// that modifies Cypress.

// You can change the location of this file or turn off loading
// the support file with the 'supportFile' configuration option.
